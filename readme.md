# GymFreaks

## Inspiration
Many times getting the motivation to go to the gym is very rare. Sometimes, trainers are not around and you don't know what to do. You might want to watch someone else perform the exercise in front of you. This is when **GymFreaks** comes into the picture.  

Augmented Reality is coming to the fitness industry and has the promise of changing the way people think about fitness technology. 

## What it does

**GymFreaks** is an augmented reality workout platform that mixes your physical environment with virtual projections, allowing you to stay present in and aware of your real world.

**GymFreaks** uses Augmented Reality to help you with your fitness goals.
You can scan the QR code beside the exercise using Google Lens. You can inspect the video playing right in front of you and get every movement right!
If you have a problem with the AR setup, you can watch the 3D video instead.
GymFreaks ensures that your gym-time counts!

AR builds on the core strengths of VR fitness, along with a number of practical advantages to other forms of fitness tech. Unlike VR headsets which can cause dizziness and pose some safety issues in fitness, AR headsets mix your physical environment with virtual projections, allowing you to stay present in and aware of your real world. AR smart glasses can even enable entirely new sports â€“ think dodgeball with force fields, airborne boxing, and rockclimbing-meets-arcade-games.
